Hepatitis C is a viral infection that causes liver inflammation, sometimes leading to serious liver damage. The hepatitis C virus (HCV) spreads through contaminated blood. Until recently, hepatitis C treatment required weekly injections and oral medications that many HCVinfected people couldn't take because of other health problems or unacceptable side effects. That's changing. Today, chronic HCV is usually curable with oral medications taken every day for two to six months. In this study, we have tried to obtain Simple Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression Models in order to truly understand if Linear Regression Models
alone are enough to predict Bilirubin levels in patients who need to be tested and diagnosed for Hepatitis C. We have used the method of Hypothesis Testing, Linear Regression Assumption Analysis, Residual Analysis on Simple Linear Regression Models and Multiple Linear Regression Models. We have used also obtained Stepwise, Forward and Backward to understand the best variables that can explain the Bilirubin levels in patients.
